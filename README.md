# Handle Inheritance in Type Inference with Modified Unification Algorithm
## Introduction

The unification algorithm is a fundamental tool used in many areas of computer science, including programming languages, artificial intelligence, and theorem proving. One of the main applications of unification is type inference, where the goal is to determine the most general type that satisfies a set of constraints.

However, traditional unification algorithms have a limitation when it comes to handling inheritance in type inference. This is where this project comes in: it provides a modification to the traditional unification algorithm that allows it to handle inheritance, resulting in a more expressive and versatile type inference system.
## Motivation

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, where one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. This allows for code reuse and abstraction, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

Typeclasses, on the other hand, provide a way to define types that have common behavior. In functional programming languages like Haskell, typeclasses are used to define type-level functions that can be reused across multiple types.

Unification, as mentioned earlier, is used in type inference to determine the most general type that satisfies a set of constraints. By modifying the unification algorithm to handle inheritance, it becomes possible to infer types that take into account inheritance and typeclasses, resulting in a more expressive type inference system.
The Modified Unification Algorithm

This project provides a modification to the traditional unification algorithm that allows it to handle inheritance in type inference. The modification involves adding rules to the algorithm that allow it to take into account the relationships between types defined through inheritance and typeclasses.

The result is a more powerful type inference system that can handle a wider range of constraints, and can infer more precise and accurate types.
## Conclusion

This project is a valuable contribution to the field of computer science, as it provides a solution to a limitation in traditional unification algorithms when it comes to handling inheritance in type inference. The modified unification algorithm can lead to more expressive and versatile type inference systems, allowing for better code reuse and abstraction, and easier code management and maintenance.
